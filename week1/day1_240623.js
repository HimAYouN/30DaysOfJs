//Variables
    // Declaration : 'var', 'let', 'const'

    let x = 12;
    var a = 33;
    const b = 23;
    
    // Data Types
        // Strings 'Hello', "Hello"
        //Numbers 8, 7.21
        //Boolean 'true', 'false'
        //Undefined  : Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value
        // Null: Represents intentional absence of valu
        // Object: Key-value pairs or collection of properties
        // Arrays: Ordered lists of values
    var msg = "Hello There";
    let count = 10;
    const isTrue = true;
    
    //Operators
        //Arithmetic operators + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus).
        //Comparison Operators: == (equality), != (inequality), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to).
        //Logical Operators: && (logical AND), || (logical OR), ! (logical NOT).
        //Assignment Operators: = (assign value), += (add and assign), -=, *=, /=, %= (similarly for other arithmetic operators).
        //Increment and Decrement Operators: ++ (increment by 1), -- (decrement by 1).
    var p = 5;
    var y = 6;
    var z = p+y;
