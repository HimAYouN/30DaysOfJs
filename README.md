# 30DaysOfJs
Me Learning Javascript in 30 days and this repo is the track record.

I completed  basics of js in about a month, Asynchronous JS took around 6-8 days and the projects part took around 16-18 days. Total of which is around 56 days (Not a month 😂).

The basics of JS is easy and will be covered in a month or so if you already know some other language, but can take two or three months if you are starting with JS as first language.

The Projects part is mentioned below: 
    With the help of ChatGPT and googling (other sites and youtube):
                
            - 📝 To-Do List : About 14 hours.
            - 🪨📃✂️ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game : About 18 hours.
            - 🕛Digital Clock & Quote Generator : About 6-7 hours.
            - ⌛ Countdown Timer : About 17-20 hours.
            - ☁️🌡️ Weather App : About 16-20 hours (Code-with-Harry youtube video )
            -🏯🎌 Anime Search Page : About 30-35 hours.
    This is all the total working hours in which a project was completed, but the time spend on a project is diffent. 
    
    The time spend on These projects is roughly 16-18 days.
        First i was making To-Do List and Rock-Paper-Scissors and that i completed i around 3 days.
        Then i was doing Digital Clock & Quote Generator and Countdown Timer and those two took me around 4 days to complete.

        In between making WeatherApp and AnimeSearchPage i was also making some improvements to my old projects  in js and css.

        Then i started making a weather app and failed and i watched a youtube video on CodeWithHarry's channel that really helped.
        The weatherApp took about 4-5 days to complete.
        After that i started my final project which includes API, Asynchronous Js and some CSS concepts, which is AnimeSearchPage,
        most of which i did myy self but got a little help from chatGPT and it took me about 6-7 days to complete this.

This repo is not that good with time tracking as it contains only 4week folders while it took me around 6-7weeks
But the next one will be good enough.
I am going to learn to react next and keep posting that in another repo, so please check my profile and i you like this repo then please give it a star ⭐.
